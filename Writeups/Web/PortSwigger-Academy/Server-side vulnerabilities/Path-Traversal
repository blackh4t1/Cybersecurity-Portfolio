# Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value:
Target and send to repeater, ensure valid request to fetch an image
Replace filename parameter like the following example: filename=../../../etc/passwd
../../../etc/passwd is used go up directories from /var/www/images/image.png to the file system root so you are actually in /etc/passwd then contents show up in Burp Suite
